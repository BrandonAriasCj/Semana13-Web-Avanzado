[00:00:03.438] Server  WARN     ⚠ The "middleware" file convention is deprecated. Please use "proxy" instead. Learn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/middleware-to-proxy
[00:00:03.443] Server  ERROR    ⨯ The file "./src\middleware.ts" must export a function, either as a default export or as a named "middleware" export.
This function is what Next.js runs for every request handled by this middleware.

Why this happens:
- The file exists but doesn't export a function.
- The export is not a function (e.g., an object or constant).
- There's a syntax error preventing the export from being recognized.

To fix it:
- Ensure this file has either a default or "middleware" function export.

[00:00:14.621] Browser ERROR   A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:

- A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.
